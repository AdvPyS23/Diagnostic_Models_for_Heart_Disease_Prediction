- [x] An implementation of code for Descriptive Statistics analysis has been uploaded.

- [x] The structure of the code was improved using the principles of abstraction and decomposition.
    - As our main goal was plotting descriptive statistics we identified that our data had only two kinds of variables which needed to be ploted differently. Therefore, we separated the variables in two categories. The key point was plot different kinds of plot for different kinds of variables and names/data from individual variable was added detail. So, we wrote a function that plots different kind of plots for different knid of variables. Within the function we decomposed the code so it would focus on individual variables belonging to different categories using a for loop. This shortened our code and we could avoid writing the same code for plotting data multiple time. Further it ensured that all the plots of the same kind looked the same
