# Introduction 

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the major causes of deaths around the globe resulting in an estimated 17.9 million deaths
each year. CHD, also known as coronary artery disease and atherosclerotic heart disease, is the result of the accumulation of 
atheromatous plaques inside the coronary arteries. The  plaque in these arteries lead to narrowing of the arteries making them 
unable to carry oxygenated blood to the heart muscle causing the well-known symptoms of CHD such as chest pain (angina) of varying 
intensity and shortness of breath. 

Deposits in the coronary arteries aren’t noticeable at first. They build up over time and start affecting the flow of blood 
through the blood vessel more and more, until one part of the heart muscle doesn’t get enough oxygen. Therefore, individuals 
with early stage of CHD might be asymptomatic which makes early diagnosis of CHD. The healthcare industry generates a lot of data
regarding patient, diseases, and diagnoses regarding CHD but it is not appropriately analyzed, so it does not have the same impact
as it should on patient health. The aim of the present work is to retrospectively analyze publicly available data from four 
different healthcare facilities to build a diagnostic model that can predict whether a person with some particular characteristics,
such as their cholesterol and the type of angina they experience, will develop a cardiovascular disease. A proper diagnostic model 
could lead to Early intervention (such as medical treatments or change in an individual’s dietary habits and lifestyle)  
to prevent or reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular events in high-risk groups .
